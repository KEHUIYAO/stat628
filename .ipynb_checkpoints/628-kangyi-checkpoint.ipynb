    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "<p> In the past, The most straightforward way to judge a person's fatness is to use the ratio of height to weight (BMI, weight divided by the square of the height). However, this method is easy to ignore the amount of body fat. Therefore, to judge a person's true degree of obesity, in addition to using BMI as a reference indicator, the body fat rate must be tested, so that the results will be more objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> There are a lot of ways designed to test body fat rate, like body-fat scale, online body-fat calculator. We try to build a model only predicts the male, a simple, robust, accurate and precise“rule-of-thumb” method to estimate the percentage of body fat based on the 252-men data set. To make sure the simplicity of the model, we try to keep one or two variable in our model.\n",

    "We use R-square to select the model, BIC foIn BIC forward-2, the ABDOMEN and WEIGHT have a negative coefficient. In this Figure, we can see the person in the left side has a big  WEIGHT, admittedly, his WEIGHT is also big, but the density of muscle is larger than the density of fat, with the large body fat instead of muscle, the increase of weight is small compared with increase of ABDOMEN. We can get a big body fat of this person. For the person on the right side, the ABDOMEN is not small, because ABDOMEN almost contains muscle. As a result, the increase in weight is bigger than the increase of ABDOMEN, we can get a small body fat of this person.rward-3 \n",

    "## 4.1 Disadvantage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy: In a trade off between simplicity and high accuracy, we prefer the former one. Thus, we delete the confirmed outliers for response variable instead of imputing them and didn't include all variables contributing to the highest accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Straightforward: Aiming at building a simple model, our final model is easy to interpret, remember, and apply into daily life.\n",
    "2. Robustness: Based on information from various kinds of models, the final model is made more accurate and robust.\n",
