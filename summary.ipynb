    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "<p> In the past, The most straightforward way to judge a person's fatness is to use the ratio of height to weight (BMI, weight divided by the square of the height). However, this method is easy to ignore the amount of body fat. Therefore, to judge a person's true degree of obesity, in addition to using BMI as a reference indicator, the body fat rate must be tested, so that the results will be more objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> There are a lot of ways designed to test body fat rate, like body-fat scale, online body-fat calculator. We try to build a model only predicts the male, a simple, robust, accurate and precise“rule-of-thumb” method to estimate the percentage of body fat based on the 252-men data set. To make sure the simplicity of the model, we try to keep one or two variable in our model.\n",

We can get a big body fat of this person. For the person on the right side, the ABDOMEN is not small, because ABDOMEN almost contains muscle.

    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: Based on common sense, the larger the abdomen circumferen, the larger the size of a person, and based on same body size, the larger the weight is, the more muscle a person owns, and the less body fat, for which our final model could be interpreted in consistency with common sense.\n",
